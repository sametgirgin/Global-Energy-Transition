### Guideline for Calculating Energy-Related Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Mt CO₂-eq)

This document provides a structured methodology for calculating and reporting energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions expressed in million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO₂-eq). It is intended for national inventories, corporate reporting, sector analyses, and lifecycle studies.

---

#### 1. Purpose and Scope

Define the objective of the assessment and clarify which emissions qualify as energy-related.

Energy-related emissions typically include:

- Fuel combustion for electricity, heat, transport, and industrial energy use  
- Fugitive emissions from fossil-fuel extraction, processing, and distribution  
- Indirect emissions from purchased electricity and heat  

Specify:

- Reporting year  
- Geographic or organizational boundaries  
- Whether non-energy industrial process emissions are included  

---

#### 2. System Boundaries

Establish boundaries consistent with IPCC, UNFCCC, or GHG Protocol frameworks.

Include:

- Combustion emissions from all fuel types  
- Upstream extraction and processing emissions (CH₄ leaks, venting, flaring)  
- Electricity and heat generation (internal or purchased)  

Exclude non-energy process emissions unless required by the scope.

---

#### 3. Greenhouse Gases and Emission Sources

Track the following gases:

- CO₂  
- CH₄  
- N₂O  
- Optional: HFCs, PFCs, SF₆ if emitted by energy systems  

Organize emissions into source categories such as:

- Electricity and heat production  
- Transport  
- Industry  
- Residential and commercial buildings  
- Upstream fuel supply  

---

#### 4. Activity Data Requirements

Collect quantitative data describing energy use and transformation:

- Fuel consumption by type (coal, oil products, natural gas, biomass, hydrogen, etc.)  
- Electricity generation, imports, and consumption  
- Heat production and consumption  
- Fuel transformation processes (refining, gas processing)  

Use national statistics, metered data, utility data, or validated international datasets.

---

#### 5. Emission Factors

Select emission factors appropriate to the region, technology, and scope.

Common sources include:

- IPCC Guidelines  
- National greenhouse gas inventory emission factors  
- IEA, GREET, and ecoinvent datasets  

Ensure factors include CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O for each fuel type and process.

---

#### 6. CO₂-Equivalent Conversion (GWP)

Convert non-CO₂ gases using Global Warming Potentials (GWP100), typically from IPCC AR5 or AR6.

CO₂-eq = Mass of Gas × GWP


This enables aggregation of emissions into a unified metric.

---

#### 7. Emission Calculations

Use the standard calculation:

Emissions (CO₂-eq) = Activity Data × Emission Factor × GWP (if applicable)

Calculate emissions separately for:

- Fuel types  
- Sectors  
- Gases  
- Lifecycle stages (combustion vs. upstream)  

Aggregate all emissions and convert the total into million tonnes:

Mt CO₂-eq = Total CO₂-eq (tonnes) ÷ 1,000,000


---

#### 8. Sectoral Allocation

Allocate emissions into consistent reporting sectors:

- Electric power generation  
- Transport  
- Industrial energy use  
- Residential and commercial buildings  
- Upstream oil and gas operations  

This breakdown supports policy design, trend analysis, and benchmarking.

---

#### 9. Quality Control and Uncertainty Assessment

Perform checks to ensure reliability and transparency:

- Completeness (all fuels and sectors included)  
- Accuracy (data quality, proper emission factors)  
- Consistency across time and methodologies  

Conduct sensitivity analyses (e.g., methane leakage rates, grid carbon intensity). Document uncertainties where possible.

---

#### 10. Reporting Requirements

Reports should include:

- Total energy-related GHG emissions (Mt CO₂-eq)  
- Breakdown by sector, fuel type, and gas  
- Description of methods, emission factors, and GWP values  
- Assumptions, exclusions, and uncertainties  
- Optional: multi-year trend analysis
