Carbon intensity (tCO₂-eq per MJ) is a quantitative indicator expressing the total lifecycle greenhouse-gas emissions associated with producing, transforming, and delivering one megajoule of usable energy. Emissions of different gases—primarily CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O—are converted into a common unit (CO₂-equivalent) using their global warming potentials over a defined time horizon, typically 100 years.

In practice, the metric integrates all relevant upstream, combustion, and downstream processes (mining, processing, transport, conversion losses, and end-use). This allows different energy carriers—such as electricity, hydrogen, natural gas, or biofuels—to be compared on a consistent thermodynamic basis. A lower carbon-intensity value indicates a lower climate impact per unit of delivered energy, making the metric a central tool in system modelling, lifecycle assessments, and policy evaluation.
